ACHIEVELIFE INFO
About AchieveLife...
	"Be the best at doing the things you do everyday"

AchieveLife is an android app that intends to gamify your life.

Our target audience is everyone from ages 9-99, anyone who owns a smartphone
and has access to the Google Play store who wants to be motivated to be 
responsible members of society. 

It benefits you by motivating you by gaining virtual experience points in four
areas. Those areas are Fitness, Intelligece, Social, and Finance. By completing
tasks in these areas you gain xp which rewards you for completing these tasks.
This in turn hopes to balance your life between these four attributes. By bringing
balance to these areas we hope that we can bring more balance to your life.
And if we are unable to bring balance you will atleast be better at the certain
attributes that you completed the tasks for.
